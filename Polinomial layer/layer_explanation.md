The polynomial layer it's a fuction that revice as an input N variables an output the sum of all monomials up to degree D multiplied by a coeficient. This coeficient is a trainable variable.

For example with two variables x_1 and x_2 and degree 2 we obtain the following polynomial: a_0 + a_1 \times x_1 + a_2 \times x_2 + a_3 \times x_1^2 + a_4 \times x_2^2 + a_5 \times x_1 \times x_2
